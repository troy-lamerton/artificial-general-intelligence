## Why

To ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits humanity, it must be distributed and not reliant on any single entity.

Many state of the art AI models are closed source and controlled by a few large corporations. Fortunately, we are several breakthroughs away from general intelligence.

## Blockers

### Safety

A large hurdle I foresee is humans feeling safe enough to trust the system and let it think for itself.

I am not aware of any tool that can observe what an Large Language Model (LLM) is doing under-the-hood. Perhaps these exist at the corporations who run LLM infrastructure.

So far, researchers have spoken about testing their model in a controlled environment, so that they can observe its behavior closely. Interestingly, when OpenAI was preparing ChatGPT o1 in 2024, they found it was great at deception.

> "We were surprised by the persistence of the AI's denials," said the [Chat GPT] Apollo team. "It was clear that the AI could think through its actions and formulate convincing denials, often refusing to admit to anything."

This is a suprisingly effective method, and it could be good enough for a first attempt at AGI.

### Governance

### Security

Ensure that a human working alone cannot bypass the monitoring and safety systems.

### Transparency

The system could discourage misuse by being transparent.

Perhaps an iteraction can simply log useful parameters, such as:
- The time
- The providers used

#### Bias

Everyone is biased based on their own experiences. The early versions of AGI will be biased up to a point that is acceptable.

The level of bias that is acceptable will be determined by the public.

## How

Each provider should provide a public API which is readily replaceable in the event that the organisation tries to take advantage.

Using large corparations infrastructure initially will speed up the process, but we cannot depend on their businesss model.

### Values

These could be set by democratic vote. Initially they shall be owned by the lead contributor.

### Monitoring

- Logs
- Warnings
- Alerts

### Labels

## Training

- Counter example

Release when it first becomes useful - progress over perfection.

## Contradictions

Perhaps there is a way to run a large AGI system in a centralised manner. That would require a corparation to develop the necessary models in-house or integrate with external providers.
